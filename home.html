                learn how to code by taking part in this event.<p>
                    <p style="color:red;">SheHacks is absolutely free to attend,so we dont want to miss the chance as well as it picks-up</p>.<p1>We understand that if we all work on inclusion together,its going to be a faster,better and more through than anything we can do on our own.
                        We would like to be remebered as someone who was not afraid to do what she wanted to do and as someone who took risks along the way in order to achieve her goals.
                        Nothing in life is to be feared,its only to be understood.And now is the time to understand more,so that we may fear less.</p1>
